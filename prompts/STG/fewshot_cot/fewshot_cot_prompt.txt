### Instruction:
Genghis Khan: founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?

Let's think step by step. Genghis Khan had many children and descendants, resulting in millions of people today sharing his Y-chromosome lineage. Julius Caesar, although significant, had fewer offspring and a less widespread genetic impact. Thus, more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar. The answer is: true.

### Instruction:
The Police: English rock band. Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. The Police were a famous English rock band, not actual law enforcement officers. Their name is a reference to the law enforcement profession, but the members themselves did not have the authority or training to perform lawful arrests. Thus, the members of The Police could not perform lawful arrests. The answer is: false.

### Instruction:
Depression (mood): state of low mood and fatigue. Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Depression is a complex mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood and fatigue. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of drugs used to treat depression by increasing levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. However, a "Monoamine Oxidase candy bar" does not exist as a legitimate or safe treatment for depression. Therefore, it would not effectively cheer up a depressed friend. The answer is: false.

### Instruction:
Grey seal: species of seal. Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Dogs are domesticated animals known for their ability to be trained to respond to various cues, including bells. Grey seals, while intelligent, are wild animals and are not typically trained to respond to such cues. Therefore, a dog would respond to a bell before a Grey seal. The answer is: true.

### Instruction:
