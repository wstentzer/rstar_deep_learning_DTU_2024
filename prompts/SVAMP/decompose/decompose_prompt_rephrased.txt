Given a question, please decompose it into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with "The answer is <a numeric answer>". When the original question is answerable, please start the subquestion with "Now we can answer the question: <original question>".

Question 1: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Four years ago, Kody's age was half of Mohamed's age. Condition 2: Mohamed is currently twice as old as 30 years. Question: What is Kody's current age?
Question 1.1: How old is Mohamed currently?
Answer 1.1: Mohamed is twice as old as 30 years, which means he is 30 * 2 = 60 years old.
Question 1.2: What was Kody's age four years ago, given that it was half of Mohamed's age at that time?
Answer 1.2: Four years ago, Mohamed was 60 - 4 = 56 years old, so Kody was half of that, which is 56 / 2 = 28 years old.
Question 1.3: Now we can answer the question: How old is Kody?
Answer 1.3: Kody is currently 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.

Question 2: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: On a moonless night, three fireflies were present. Condition 2: An additional number of fireflies joined, totaling four less than a dozen. Condition 3: After the joining, two of the fireflies flew away. Question: How many fireflies remained after the two flew away?
Question 2.1: How many fireflies joined?
Answer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. The answer is 8.
Question 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?
Answer 2.2: Three fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = 9 remaining. The answer is 9.

Question 3: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Ali possesses four $10 bills and six $20 bills as savings from working for Mr. James on his farm. Condition 2: Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Condition 3: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. Question: What is the amount of money Ali has left after purchasing the dinner?
Question 3.1: How much money does Ali have after giving half of his total money to his sister?
Answer 3.1: Ali initially has four $10 bills and six $20 bills, totaling 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. Giving half of this to his sister leaves him with 160 / 2 = 80 dollars. The answer is 80.
Question 3.2: How much money does Ali spend on dinner?
Answer 3.2: Ali uses 3/5 of his remaining money, which is 80 dollars, to buy dinner. Therefore, he spends 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars on dinner. The answer is 48.
Question 3.3: Now we can answer the question: How much money does Ali have after buying the dinner?
Answer 3.3: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.

Question 4: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns and must navigate through a ring requiring a total of 4 right-hand turns to exit. Condition 2: After the 1st turn, the car travels 5 meters. Condition 3: After the 2nd turn, the car travels 8 meters. Condition 4: After the 4th turn, the car immediately exits the tunnel. Condition 5: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. Question: How far did the car travel after the 3rd turn before exiting the tunnel?
Question 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?
Answer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The answer is 13.
Question 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?
Answer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.
