But since we know it took full 4 hour trip including resting period so this means he didn\u2019t cover these additional distances due to standing still (he drove only actual travelled duration). Hence even though theoretically if all goes right according plan i.e., no delay or stop etc, he would need another one hour just like initially spent travelling same 180 miles back hence effectively making net journey zero as well thus not adding anything extra towards return route into account too resulting overall resultant place remains unchanged despite seemingly long complicated scenario described basically ending up having driven exact amount backwards whatsoever causing us ultimately arriving exactly at starting point again meaning displacement relative to original position ends out being nil irrespective whether considering whole four hrs planned schedule detail taking everything mentioned literally without any assumptions about 'very important thing'.

Lastly, compute the distance covered within the remainder of the trip at 80 mph over 3 hours: 80 miles per hour times 3 hours equals 240 miles. Summing these distances yields: 0 + 15 + 240 = 255 miles.
