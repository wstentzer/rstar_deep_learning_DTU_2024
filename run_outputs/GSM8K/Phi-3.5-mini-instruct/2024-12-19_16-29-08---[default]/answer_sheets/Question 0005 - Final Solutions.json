That means we multiply the standard price which stands as follows: Eight times fifty equals four hundred dollars spent normally without any reduction or special deals applied. Next up, let us calculate what happens when these reductions kick into play; sixteen divided by twenty percent represents twelve units since each such unit corresponds to a pairing event involving both normal rate and lower rates within our range. Thusly, applying multiplication reveals twelve multiplied against three makes thirty-six dollars saved through those particular pairs affected by said reduction scheme \u2013 henceforth leading

Thus those cheaper drinks equate up to 8*(5/2) =<<8*2.5=20>> $20 less than if everything was full price.
