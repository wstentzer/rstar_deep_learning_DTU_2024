However, since no specific increase rate was provided let's keep things consistent using initial values only but scaling them up linearly according to time passed. Let y denote weeks elapsed into future planning period; thus month duration can roughly equate to around four complete cycles because typically most people plan their long term goals starting right away(a year divided into quarter periods): Thus overall calculated estimation comes down to: Expected_Distance=y*(monthly equivalent)*[distance coverd per week]In numerical terms assuming typical progression factor doesn't apply here & sticking strictly onto original calculation formula, expected mileage could look something along following lines :Expected_Distance=(y*4)*[120X].
