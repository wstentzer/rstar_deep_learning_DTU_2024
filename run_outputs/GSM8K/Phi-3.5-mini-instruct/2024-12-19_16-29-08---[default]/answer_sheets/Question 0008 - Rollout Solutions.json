Firstly, he managed to cover another quarter of an hour (half-an-hour divided into four quarters), meaning two minutes ((0.5)/(60)), as duration usually measured here tends towards seconds not fractions of minute we divide these two minutes again taking one second unit each giving us six units representing sixth fractional portion of an entire hour [(2/60)*6]. As such while travelling at lower pace of 30mph over span equivalent to 'sixth': (30*(2/60))/(6)=<<30*(2/60)/6=1>>1 milestone gained..

With high efficiency enabled afterwards, John would cover roughly another 400 miles effectively which equals together both periods totalling :\n180+400=$<<180+400=580>>580 miles\n\nSince all movements resulted either directly toward home (-180), not affecting position (+0), forward past starting point (=positive value like mentioned hereafter)+400,-it indicates overall displacement rather than specific location relative to origin (home).
