At a speed of 2 GB per minute, it would usually take her 100 / 2 = 50 minutes to reach this point.\n\nNow, let's consider the extra waiting times. As stated earlier, these happen twice until reaching the middle of the download. Each wait lasts 20 minutes. Therefore, the additional waiting time adds another 20 + 20 = 40 minutes.\n\nSo, adding together the initial expected duration (50 minutes) and the extended durations due to pauses ((40 minutes), results in a new total upload period of 50 + 40 = <<50+40=90>>90 minutes.\n\nThis means instead of taking approximately 2 hours (which would typically allow complete download overview assuming no pause incidents occurring)(this assumes perfect conditions otherwise average speeds might fluctuate slightly depending also partly other variables like network quality affective among others)-in fact thanks to those sudden obstacles brought onto us courtesy Microsoft Updates!
