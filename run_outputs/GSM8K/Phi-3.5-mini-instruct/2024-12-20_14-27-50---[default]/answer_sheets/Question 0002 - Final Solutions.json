Given information also states that due to these improvements, the overall worthiness/value rose upwards by 150%, meaning it became 2.5 times its previous state because when something increases or decreases over certain percentage points 'upward', you add one whole increment hence if X% increase happens twice consecutively; therefore resulting equivalent rise becomes ((X*Y)*Z)/100=Total Raiser %. Here Z being Y would mean same variable but different percentages representing separate rounds thus making sense since increasing thrice doesn't simply multiply three times likewise doubling thrice isn't tripled double multiplication instead multiplicative progression occurs here . Thus applying such principle yields us following formula : Initial Cost*(Initial Value+ValueIncrease%)\u00d72. Substituting values mentioned above results $(130,000)[(.8+$150)]^2$.

Since our earlier calculations show that combined capital outlay amounts to $130,000 prior to appreciation factor being introduced; hence, following calculation applies here: Final Value= Previous Total Cost+Appreciated Amount->FinalValue=$130,000+(($130,000)*150%) ->$130,000+$195,000 ->$325,000 .
