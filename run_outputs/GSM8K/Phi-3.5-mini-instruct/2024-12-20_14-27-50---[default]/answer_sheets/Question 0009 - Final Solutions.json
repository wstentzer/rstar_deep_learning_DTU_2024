Condition 3: This particular week, Eliza clocked \\\\(\\boxed{45}\\) working hours. Based on her rates, calculate what would be her gross income for this period. Answer: To determine Eliza's earnings for the week where she worked 45 hours, we must consider both her normal wage rate and her overtime wage rate.
