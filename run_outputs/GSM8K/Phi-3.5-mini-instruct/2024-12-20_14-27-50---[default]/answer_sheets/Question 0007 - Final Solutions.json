It takes \\( \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\) minutes under perfect circumstances. However, we know from Condition 3 that around every third part of the process experiences delay because of system updates, which lasts for about 20 minutes causing restarts until completion. This means within those three parts, there could potentially be twice such a pause (once when starting mid progress). Thus theoretically adding another \\(\\frac{2*20}{3}\\) times into our calculation since not just once but possibly twice can happen during incomplete segments leading till full cycles through restart phases. Yet, exactly quantifying additional duration requires knowing specific details like frequency of breaks caused due to other reasons apart from auto-update installments too alongside their potential impact overlaps etc., hence providing precise numbers remains uncertain thereby signalling increased complexity beyond basic calculations while reflectively addressing practical constraints inherently tied intrinsic digital operations dynamics represented thus via cumulative timeline measurements encapsulating variable operability facets symbolising collective effort towards achieving targeted objectivity i.e.'total_time'.

That means out of four equal segments(or quarters) , only first quarter goes smooth while remaining go affected causing approximate halving their progress thus effectively making them equivalent to less than actual expected completion over same period but specifically \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Hence its effective proportion comes down to (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)*1)*\\(\\frac{4}{4}=\\frac{8}{12}=0.666...\\).
