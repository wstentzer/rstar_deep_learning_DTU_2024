Next, we need to determine what part of those four hours allotted toward getting back still remained unused due to standing stopped for the initial two hours plus another one half hour spent travelling slower than intended average rate i.e., at only 30 miles/hr instead of planned standard pace most probably close to or slightly lesser as calculated below; specifically since no further speeds other than stated ones above made it clear otherwise here either way: Speed difference would mean reduced overall progress over respective periods thus shorter effective useable duration within set deadlines hence requiring compensation via faster segments later \u2013 although details remain unclear without additional info explicitly stating so directly perhaps indirect clues could help deduce such missing elements likewise considering possibility existence potential variations affecting timings possibly based upon earlier vs current conditions etc..
