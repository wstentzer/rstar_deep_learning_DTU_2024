Since 3/4 of the apartments are occupied, we know that the remaining 1/4 are unoccupied, which means 1/4 of the total number of apartments are unoccupied. So the total number of unoccupied apartments is 1/4 * 120 = 30. The answer is: 30.\n\nHint 2: Let's suppose there are A vacant apartments and B occupied apartments. Since 3/4 of the apartments are occupied, we can write this as B = 3A/4 or equivalently B/A = 3/4. We want to know the value of A (the number of vacant apartments). To solve for A, we can multiply both sides of the equation by A: B = 3A^2/4. This leads us to the following equation: B = 3A^2/4. Rearranging terms, we get 3A^2 = 4B. Dividing both sides by 4, we obtain A^2 = B/2. Taking the square root of both sides, we have A = sqrt(B/2). Since B = 120, we substitute this value into the equation to get A = sqrt(120/2) = sqrt(60) = 8. This tells us that the number of vacant apartments is 8.
