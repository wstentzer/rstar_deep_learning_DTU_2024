Researching and writing one article takes on average 4 hours. To find out how long it took Meredith to write all the articles in all three days, we need to add up all the time she spent doing this. Let's look at the amount of articles she wrote on each of the three days. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more than Monday. That means she wrote 10 articles (5 x 2/5). On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many as Tuesday. That would be 20 articles. It would take 5*4 = 20 hours to write 5 articles. It would take 10*4 = 40 hours to write 10 articles. And it would take 20*4 = 80 hours to write 20 articles. We add up all the hours: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.
