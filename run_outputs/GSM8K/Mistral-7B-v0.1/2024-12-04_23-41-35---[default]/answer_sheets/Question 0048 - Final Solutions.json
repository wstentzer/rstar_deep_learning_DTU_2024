First we cut it into 6-inch pieces. 6 / 12 of the 4 feet gets used up. So there are 4 - 6 / 12 = 4 * 12 / 6 = 12/6 = 2 feet left over. That means there are 2 * 6 / 12 = 1 feet left over. There are three of those in each piece, so 1 * 3 = 3.

Therefore, we need to calculate the number of pieces that can fit into one foot. To do this, first we can find out how many times we can divide 1 foot by 1/2. We can get this by dividing 1 by 1/2 which is 2 feet. This means we can get two pieces from one foot of wire. Secondly, we need to figure out how many pieces are made from the entire wire. To do this, we can multiply the number of feet by the number of pieces we can make per foot. Since there are 4 feet of wire and we can make 2 pieces per foot, we can get (4 * 2) pieces from the entire wire which equals 8 pieces. Therefore, there are 8 such pieces produced from this wire.
