Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So if we consider them all to be integer numbers, that means (i) Brandon's iPhone is 4n (ii) Ben's iPhone is 2n, and (iii) Suzy's iPhone is n, where n is a positive integer. From (i), Brandon's iPhone is 4n years old. From (iii), Ben's iPhone is 2n years old. We need to find how old Ben's iPhone is, so we have to eliminate n, or in other words, solve (ii) for n. We can write: 2n = Brandon's iPhone age / Ben's iPhone age = 4n/2n = 4/2 = 2. We get n = 1. Finally, this means that Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 years old = 2 years old.
