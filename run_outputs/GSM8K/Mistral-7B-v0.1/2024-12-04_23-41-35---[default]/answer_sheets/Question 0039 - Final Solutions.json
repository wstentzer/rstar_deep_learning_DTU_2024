And we also know her running speed is four times faster than 1.5 miles per hour which is 6 miles per hour. If she can spend one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking, that means she can run for 2 hours (because it's two thirds of the time) and she can walk for 4 hours (because it's one third of the time). So Dana can run for 2 hours at a speed of 6 miles per hour, which means she can run 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

Similarly, if the speed of walking is 1/4 of the speed of running, then it would mean that the speed of walking is 0.25 units per hour.\n\nNow, let us calculate the total distance traveled by Dana in six hours. For this, we need to first determine the total amount of time spent in running and walking. As mentioned earlier, Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the amount of time spent in running would be 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours and the amount of time spent in walking would be 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours.\n\nNow, using the equation of distance covered at constant speed, we can find out the total distance covered by Dana in six hours. The total distance covered by Dana while running in 2 hours at a speed of 4R units per hour would be 2R units. Similarly, the total distance covered by Dana while walking in 4 hours at a speed of 0.25W units per hour would be 1 units. Therefore, the total distance covered by Dana in six hours would be 2R + 1 = 2R + 0.25W.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the total distance covered by Dana by 6, the number of hours, to obtain the total distance traveled by Dana in six hours.

Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk. So let's say she runs at a speed of 4 times the speed she walks, or 4*speed_walking.

So Dana can run at a speed of speed_walking, and skip at a speed of 0.5*X = 0.5*speed_walking. The question says that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. So 3 = 0.5*speed_walking. speed_walking = 3/0.5 = 6. Dana can run 6 miles in one hour, and skip 3 miles in one hour. So let's assume the first third of the time is spent running, and the other two-thirds of the time is spent skipping. Since we are talking about time, let's say 1 hour = 1 unit of time. In 1 unit of time, Dana will run for 1/3 of the time, which is 1/3 of an hour, or 1/3. She will also spend 2/3 of the time skipping, which is 2/3 of an hour, or 2/3.

First, let's figure out how long Dana will spend running and walking. One-third of six hours is 2 hours. Two-thirds of 6 hours is 4 hours. She spent 2 hours running and 4 hours walking. Let's also find out how far Dana can run in 2 hours and walk in 4 hours. Dana runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour. If she runs for 2 hours, she will cover 4 * 2 = 8 miles. Dana walks at a rate of 0.75 miles per hour. If she walks for 4 hours, she will cover 0.75 * 4 = 3 miles. Now we know that she will cover 8 miles running and 3 miles walking. So she will cover 8 + 3 = 11 miles.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so if her walking speed is 1 mile per hour, her running speed is 4 miles per hour. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, which means it is 3 / 2 = 3/4 miles per hour. In six hours, if she runs for one-third of the time (2 hours), then she would spend the remaining two-thirds of the time walking (4 hours). Let's represent these times using variables: T is the total time spent running and walking, R is the time spent running, and W is the time spent walking. We know that R + W = T and R = 2. Therefore, W = T - R = T - 2. To calculate the distance traveled while running, we multiply the running speed and the time spent running: R x RS = 4R = 8T. To calculate the distance traveled while walking, we multiply the walking speed and the time spent walking: W x WS = WS x (T - 2) = WS x T - 2WS = 4WS - 2WS = 2WS. Finally, we add the distances traveled while running and walking together: 8T + 2WS = 8T + 2(4WS - 2WS) = 8T + 8WS - 4WS = 12WS + 8T. The answer is 12WS + 8T.

Her skipping rate is therefore half of 4 * her walking rate. Now we know all rates. Next is the fourth condition, Dana covers a distance of 3 miles when skipping. Let's call that rate R.
