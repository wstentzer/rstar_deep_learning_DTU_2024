{"id": 66, "problem": "There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls\u2019 basketball team and a boys\u2019 basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each school has sent 1 girls\u2019 basketball team + 1 boys\u2019 basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.\nSo each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.\nThey have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.\nIn total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.\nTherefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.\n#### 48", "gold_answer": "48"}
