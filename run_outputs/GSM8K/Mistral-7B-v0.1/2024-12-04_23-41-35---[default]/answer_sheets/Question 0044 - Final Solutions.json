For one pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles. Let's call this amount x pounds. Then 10x is the number of candles. Since he wants to make and sell 20 candles, it means that 10x = 20. Dividing both sides of the equation by 10 will get us x = 2. So Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax. To calculate supplies, we know the supply for each pound is $10.00. So 2 pounds of beeswax costs 2 x $10.00 = $20.00. This means that the cost of making 20 candles is $20.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, the revenue of 20 candles will be 20 x $2.00 = $40.00. So his profit would be revenue minus cost, or 40 - 20 = 20.00.
