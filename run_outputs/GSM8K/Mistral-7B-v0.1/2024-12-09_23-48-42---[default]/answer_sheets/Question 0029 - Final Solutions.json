Gloria needs to buy a new pair of shoes within a certain budget. We also know that she found a pair of boots that cost exactly what she could spend. However, instead of buying just one pair of boots, she has the option of buying two different pairs of heels. Each pair has a different price tag: one is priced at $33, and the other is twice the price of the first. The total price of these heels is $5 cheaper than the price of the boots. Let's try to figure out the exact price of the boots. Since we know that the total price of the heels is $5 less than the price of the boots, let's call the price of the boots x. Therefore, the total price of the heels is x - 5. This means that (x - 5) / 2 is equal to $33, and 2(x - 5) is equal to the price of the second pair of heels. Solving this equation, we get x - 5 = $33/2 or x = $33 + 5 = $38. Thus, the exact price of the boots is $38.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Question: What is the exact price of the boots?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We want to know the exact price of the boots. Given that she found a suitable pair of boots that cost exactly what she can spend, this means that the boots will be equal to the amount of money she has. Since she can spend within a certain budget, this means that she has a limited amount of money. Since she wants to buy a new pair of shoes, this means that the shoes cost something. Now, we have three variables: the amount of money she has, the cost of the shoes, and the cost of the boots. Let's say the amount of money she has is A, the cost of the shoes is B, and the cost of the boots is C. We also know that she can find a suitable pair of boots that cost exactly what she can spend, so C = A. From condition 3, we know that she can opt for two different pairs of heels, which together cost $5 less than the boots. This means that (B+C) - 5 = C. Substituting in our previous equation of C=A gives us B+A-5=A. Rearranging gives us B=5. From condition 4, one pair of heels costs $33, while the other costs twice as much. This means that B=33 and 2*B=66. Combining these equations gives us 33+66=99.
