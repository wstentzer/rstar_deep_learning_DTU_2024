{"id": 5, "problem": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64", "gold_answer": "64"}
