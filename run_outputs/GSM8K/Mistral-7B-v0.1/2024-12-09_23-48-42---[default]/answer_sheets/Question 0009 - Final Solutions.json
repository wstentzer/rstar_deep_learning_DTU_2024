This is $10. Since the problem says she also gets an overtime pay, it means there are other hours she works besides those first 40. In this case, it is those extra 5 hours. For those extra 5 hours, she makes 1.2 times as much. Let's see how much Eliza earns for the first 40 hours, then add that to what she earns for the last 5. For the first 40 hours, Eliza's rate is $10 per hour, so she earns 40x$10= $400. To calculate her overtime hours, we need to know what Eliza's rate per hour is for those extra hours. Her rate per hour is 1.2 times as much as her base rate. So Eliza's rate per hour for those extra 5 hours is 1.2 x $10 = $12. Since she only worked 5 extra hours, she earns $12 x 5 = $60. Putting everything together, Eliza earns $400 for her first 40 hours, and another $60 for her last 5, making her total earnings for the week $400+$60=$460.
