Subtracting this number from the remaining amount of people (16) gives us 12. So, we know there are 12 students left. Since we know 25% enrolled in jazz dance, we can divide 12 by 0.25 (since 25% = 0.25). This gives us 48 students. There are 20 students in the dance class. Let's use this information to find out what percentage of students enrolled in hip hop dance. To do this, we subtract 48 from 20. This leaves us with 12 students.

In the dance class, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance. First, let's figure out how many students remain. After removing those who took contemporary dance (20%), there are 80% of the 20 students remaining. So 80% of 20 students remains. 80% = 80/100. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get 80 = 80% * 100. 80% = 80 / 100. Again, 80% = 80 / 100. So 80% equals 4/5. Therefore, 4/5 of the original 20 students are still in the class. We need to find the remaining percentage of students. 4/5 * 100% = 400 / 500, or 80% is the remaining percentage of students. Now, let's take the 25% of the remaining. This means 25% of 80%. To find this, we need to divide 80% by 100, and then multiply it by 100 again. This makes sense because 25% can be written as 25 / 100, so dividing by 100 just simplifies the expression. 25 / 100 = 1 / 4. Next, multiply by 100. We get 25 = 25 / 100 * 100.

To calculate this, we need to multiply 25 / 100 by 80. 25 / 100 * 80 = 1 / 4 * 80 = 20. Therefore, 25% of 80% is 20%. This means that 20% of the original 20 students took jazz dance.

That means 20/100 * 20 = 4 students enroll in contemporary dance.\n\nThe second condition says that 25% of the remaining students enroll in jazz dance. Since we already know that 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we can subtract them from the total number of students to get the remaining students. So, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students.\n\nNow, we multiply 16 by 25/100, which means 16% of 16 students enroll in jazz dance.

But we need to find the percentage of those who enrolled in hip-hop dance. Hip-hop is not mentioned in the conditions, so we cannot calculate it directly. However, if we take the percentage of all dance classes combined (contemporary, jazz, and hip-hop), then subtract the percentages of contemporary and jazz dance, we will be left with the percentage of hip-hop dance.\n\nTo find the percentage of all dance classes combined, we add up the percentages of each class. Contemporary dance is 4/20, which equals to 20%. Jazz dance is 2.4/16, which equals to 15%. And since hip-hop dance is not mentioned, let's assume it is 20% as well (just for the calculation).\n\nSo the percentage of all dance classes combined would be 20% + 15% + 20%, which equals to 55%.\n\nFinally, we subtract the percentages of contemporary and jazz dance from the percentage of all dance classes combined: 55% - 20% - 15% = 20%. This means that 20% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, 20% of the total number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\n\nWe can convert this percentage into a decimal value by dividing it by 100. So, 20/100 = 0.2.
