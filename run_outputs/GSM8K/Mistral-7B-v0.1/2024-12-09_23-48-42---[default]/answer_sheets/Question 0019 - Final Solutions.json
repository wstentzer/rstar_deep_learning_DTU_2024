The first part of Marissa's hike was walking the first 4 miles, which took 1 hour. That means she walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her average speed was 4 miles per hour. The second part of her hike was walking the next 2 miles, which also took 1 hour. So, she walked 2 miles in 1 hour, so her average speed during the second part was 2 miles per hour. Let's call x the number of miles of the third part and let's call y the number of hours it takes Marissa to walk that part. Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. In order to do this, she needs to walk the remaining distance in 1 hour. This means that she must walk the remaining distance in y/x hours. To solve this equation, we need to know what x and y are. To find out what x and y are, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the entire hike was 12 miles long and it took Marissa 3 hours to complete. This means that the remaining distance is 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles. We also know that Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour, which means that she must have walked 6 miles in the third hour. Therefore, x = 6 and y = 1. Plugging these values into our equation, we get: 1 = 6/x Plugging x = 6 into the equation, we get: 1 = 6/6 = 1 This tells us that y/x = 1. This means that Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour.
