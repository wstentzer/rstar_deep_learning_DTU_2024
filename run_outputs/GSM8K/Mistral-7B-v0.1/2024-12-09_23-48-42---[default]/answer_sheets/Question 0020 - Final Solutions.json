That means there are (two-thirds) * 10 = 2/3 * 10 = 6.67 liters of water. Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. That means there are (three-fifths) * 15 = 3/5 * 15 = 9.00 liters of water. When we combine them all together, there will be 6.67 + 9.00 = 15.67 liters of water.

If you want to mix two drinks together, first work out what fraction of the first drink is water. Then multiply by the original volume of the first drink. Second, do the same thing for the second drink. Third, combine the two volumes, subtracting off any water that was lost in the process. Finally, divide the result by the total volume of liquid. The result will be the proportion of water in the resulting mixture. Here, you want to find the water content of the final 24-liter mixture. Start by finding the water contents of each individual component. First, the orange juice contains two thirds water. This means the other one third is pineapple juice. Now that we know the water content of the orange juice, we can calculate the original volume: (1/3) \u00d7 10 = 3. Next, find the water content of the pineapple juice. We know that it is three fifths water, which means the other two fifths is pineapple juice. Therefore the volume of the pineapple juice is equal to ((2/5) \u00d7 15) = 6. Next, figure out how much water is present in the mixture of the two drinks. Since you only poured in 9 liters of the mixture, the mixture contains the full amount of orange juice but only 9/10 of the pineapple juice, since 1 liter was spilled. Thus, we need to subtract 1 liter from the volume of the pineapple juice. 6 \u2013 1 = 5. Now that we have calculated all the necessary numbers, we can find the water content of the final mixture. 3 + 5 = 8. The water content of the final mixture is 8.
