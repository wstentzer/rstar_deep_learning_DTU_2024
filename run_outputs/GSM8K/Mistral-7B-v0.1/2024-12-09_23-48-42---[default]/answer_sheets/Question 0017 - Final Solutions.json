To calculate the annual salary, we need to know the number of weeks that Jill worked, which is 50. Also, the number of hours she taught per week is 35 and the number of hours she coached per week is 15. We can use this information to figure out the amount of money she made teaching and coaching. Let's start with teaching. Since Jill earned $20 per hour, we can multiply it by the number of hours she taught to get the total amount of money she made teaching. 35 x $20 = $700. That means Jill earned $700 per week teaching. To find out her annual earnings from teaching, we can multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she worked. 50 x $700 = $35,000. So Jill earned $35,000 annually for teaching. Next, let's look at coaching. Since Jill earned $30 per hour, we can multiply it by the number of hours she coached to get the total amount of money she made coaching. 15 x $30 = $450. That means Jill earned $450 per week coaching. To find out her annual earnings from coaching, we can again multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she worked. 50 x $450 = $22,500. So Jill earned $22,500 annually for coaching. To sum it all up, Jill earned $35,000 annually from teaching and $22,500 annually from coaching.
