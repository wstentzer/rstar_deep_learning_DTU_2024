{"id": 30, "problem": "Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18\nSince the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99\nIf Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old\n#### 109", "gold_answer": "109"}
