The original total was $50. 16.50 went into chicken and milk, so that leaves $50 - 16.50 = 33.50. To find how many boxes there are, we can divide the rest by the price per box.

We know that she spent $16.50 on chicken and milk items, and $33.50 remains for other things. Therefore, the remaining amount is $33.50 - $16.50 = $17.
