Every day, Wendi feeds her chickens three meals. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed for each meal. Each meal contains a mix of seeds, mealworms, and vegetables. She gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning, 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. The question asks us to figure out how much feed she needs to give her chickens for the third meal of the day if she has 20 chickens. We can work this out like this: First we need to know how much feed she would need for all of her chickens in one meal. Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed. So the chickens will need 3 x 20 cups of feed. That is 60 cups of feed for all of the chickens in one meal. Now we want to know how many times Wendi feeds the chickens. She feeds them 3 times, once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once in the evening. So Wendi feeds the chickens 3 meals total in one day. So to get the amount of feed she will need in one meal, we need to multiply the amount of feed each chicken needs by the number of chickens, 3 x 20 = 60. Then we can multiply the amount of feed needed for each meal by the number of meals, since she feeds them 3 times a day, 60 x 3 = 180. This tells us how much feed she will need in one day. But Wendi also told us she fed the chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. To find how much more feed she needs to feed them in the evening, we subtract what she already fed them from what she needs. 180 - (15 + 25) = 140.
