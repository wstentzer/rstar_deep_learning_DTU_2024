The price of blue ties is $p. So the price of red ties is 1.5p. If he spent $200 on x blue ties, then it means x blue ties cost him $200. That is, x times $p = $200. We know that x times $p = $200, so we can solve for p. 200/x = p. We want to find the price per tie, so let's multiply both sides by 40 to divide by x. So 200 / x = p. 200 / x * 40 = 200 * 40 / x.

First, we need to figure out how many blue ties John bought. The problem says he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. We can write this as x = 2 * y. Rewrite this to get y = x / 2. The problem also says the price of red ties is 50% more expensive than blue ties. We can write this as r = 1.5p.\n\nNow let's use these equations to solve for the number of red ties and the price of blue ties. From the first equation, we know that x = 2y. Substituting this into the second equation, we get r = 1.5p. Solving for r, we get r = 1.5(2y) = 3y. Since we already know the value of y, we can substitute it into the expression 3y to find the value of r. y = x / 2, so 3y = (3x) / 2. Substituting this into our previous equation for r, we get r = 3x / 2. This tells us that the price of red ties is (3x) / 2 dollars.\n\nSince we now know the price of red ties, we can find the total amount spent on ties. The problem states that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. This means he spent 200 / 40 = 5 times as much on blue ties as he did on red ties. To find the total amount spent on ties, we multiply the amount spent on blue ties by 5. Since the price of red ties is (3x) / 2, the total amount spent on ties is 5 times this: 5(3x) / 2 = (15x) / 2.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the amounts spent on both types of ties. This is the value of x plus the value of 15x / 2, or x + 15x / 2. Simplifying this, we get (2 + 15)x / 2. This simplifies to 17x / 2. To get rid of fractions, we multiply by 2 and get 34x.
