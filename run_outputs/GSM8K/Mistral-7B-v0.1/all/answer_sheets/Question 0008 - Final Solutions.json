We know the speed is 60mph for 3 hours, 30 mph for half an hour, and 80 mph for 4 hours. So we can use the equation d = st, which represents the formula Distance = Speed * Time. So let's plug in the numbers. Firstly, the distance when speed was 60 is d = 60*3, which equals 180. Next, the distance when speed was 30 is d = 30*.5, which equals 15. Lastly, the distance when speed was 80 is d = 80*4, which equals 320. Altogether, 180 + 15 + 320 is 515 miles.
