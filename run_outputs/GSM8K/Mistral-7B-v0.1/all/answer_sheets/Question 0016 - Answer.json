{"id": 16, "problem": "Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.\nThey also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.\nThe combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles\nThe average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train\n#### 230", "gold_answer": "230"}
