That is condition 1. It was mentioned that when refilling, she needed 4 gallons of gas. That is condition 2. We were also told that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. That is condition 3. We need to find how many miles Sophia can drive using only one full tank of gas in her vehicle. Condition 1 says 100 miles have been driven since the last time Sophia filled her car's gas tank. Since the tank has 12 gallons of gas, each mile uses up 12 / 100 = 1/8 gallon of gas. So it takes (100) / (1/8) = 800 miles until the gasoline in her car runs out. This is condition 4.
