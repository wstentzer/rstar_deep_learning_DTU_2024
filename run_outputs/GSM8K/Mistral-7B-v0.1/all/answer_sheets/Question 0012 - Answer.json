{"id": 12, "problem": "Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5\nHe earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5\nIt will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12\nHe will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13\n#### 13", "gold_answer": "13"}
