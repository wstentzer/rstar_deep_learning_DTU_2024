{"id": 7, "problem": "Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB\nThen divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes\nThen find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes\nThen add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes\n#### 160", "gold_answer": "160"}
