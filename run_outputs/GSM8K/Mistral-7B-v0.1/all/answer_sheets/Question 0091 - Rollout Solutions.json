Substituting these values into the equation above, we get (n - 2) - 2 = 3n. Simplifying this equation gives us 3n - 2n - 4 = 0. Solving for n gives us n = 4/3.

This means Marcia has 1/3 of Jan's pets."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know Jan has 3x the number of pets as Marcia. And we know that Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. That's 2 + Cindy's pet count. Let's call that variable k. k + 2 = 1/3 * 3x. So k + 2 = 3x / 3. k + 2 = x. Rearranging, we get x = k + 2. Substituting into the original equation gives us 3(k+2) = 1/3 * k. Multiply both sides by 3/3 and simplifying, we get 3k + 6 = k. Simplify again, we get k + 6 = k. Subtract k from both sides, and we get k + 6 - k = k - k. 6 = 0. This implies that there are no pets! However, since Cindy has 4 pets, this cannot be right. Therefore, our assumptions about the variables are incorrect, and we must go back to the beginning. Looking again at Jan having 3x the number of pets as Marcia, we see that this equation can only hold if x is greater than zero (i.e., if Marcia has at least one pet). Similarly, we see that our equation that says Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy requires that k be greater than or equal to 2. So let's try another value for k, say k=3. Then k + 2 = 3, so k + 2 - k = 3 - 3 = 0, so x = k + 2 - k = 3 - 3 = 0. But if x is zero, that means Jan has no pets. Therefore, our choice of k was wrong, and we need to choose a different value for k. This time let's choose k=4. Then k + 2 = 4, so k + 2 - k = 4 - 4 = 0, so x = k + 2 - k = 4 - 4 = 0. Again, if x is zero, then Jan has no pets. So our choice of k was wrong. Trying again, let's choose k=5. Then k + 2 = 5, so k + 2 - k = 5 - 5 = 0, so x = k + 2 - k = 5 - 5 = 0. Again, if x is zero, then Jan has no pets. So our choice of k was wrong. Trying yet again, let's choose k=6. Then k + 2 = 6, so k + 2 - k = 6 - 6 = 0, so x = k + 2 - k = 6 - 6 = 0. Again, if x is zero, then Jan has no pets. So our choice of k was wrong. Finally, let's choose k=7. Then k + 2 = 7, so k + 2 - k = 7 - 7 = 0, so x = k + 2 - k = 7 - 7 = 0. But if x is zero, that means Jan has no pets.
