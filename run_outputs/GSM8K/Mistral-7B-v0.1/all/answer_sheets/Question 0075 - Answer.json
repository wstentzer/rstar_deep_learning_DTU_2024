{"id": 75, "problem": "Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32\nLevel 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64\nLevel 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128\nThe four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240\nThe average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60\n#### 60", "gold_answer": "60"}
