First we need to understand what is being asked here. We are asked how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand while holding the gemstone. From this we can see that the dragon is throwing fireballs with a radius of 1000 feet around him (the dragons flame radius). Polly can throw her javelin 400 feet away, but if she is holding the gemstone she can throw it 1200 feet away. What we want to know is how far outside the radius of the dragons flames Polly can stand while holding the gemstone. If she stands 400 feet away from the dragon without the gemstone she will be caught in the flame. If she stands 1200 feet away from the dragon with the gemstone she will also be caught in the flame because the flame radius is 1000 feet. So we must find out how far outside the radius of the dragons flames Polly can stand with the gemstone. To figure this out we first add the distance the javelin can travel with the gemstone to the radius of the dragons flames (1200 feet + 1000 feet).
