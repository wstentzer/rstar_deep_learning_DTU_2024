Combined they sold 88,000 copies. Since Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, then she sold 10 * Harald's sales. 10 * Harald's sales is called X. We also know that their combined sales were 10X + Y. So 88000 = 10X + Y. Let's replace the X with the 10 * Harald's sales. 88000 = (10 * Harald's sales) + Y. Since we don't know what Harald's sales was, let's call it Z. That way we can substitute Z into the equation like this: 88000 = (10 * Z) + Y. Now let's solve for Y: 88000 - 10Z = Y. Let's plug in the value of Z, which is Harald's sales. So 88000 - 10Harald's sales = Y. If you solve this equation, you get Y = 88000 - 10Harald's sales = 88000 - 10Z. This means that Harald's sales was equal to Z. Plugging in Z for Harald's sales, we see that the equation becomes 88000 = 10Z + Z.
