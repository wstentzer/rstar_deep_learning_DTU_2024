First we need to calculate the 25% discount. 19.50 is 25% of some number. If x is this number, then 19.50 is 25% of x. Or 25% of x is 19.50. That means 4x is 19.50. Divide both sides by 4. x is equal to 19.50 / 4. x is equal to 4.875. So the original price was 4.875 dollars more than the 19.50 dollars that Kyle paid. 19.50 + 4.875 is 24.375.
