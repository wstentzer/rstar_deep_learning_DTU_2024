Since Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day, the total amount of dog food needed in the first 180 days is 180 cups.\n\nNow, let's consider the amount of dog food Cecilia needs for the remaining days of the puppy's life. According to the information provided, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day starting from the 181st day until the end of its life. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total number of days in the remaining part of the puppy's life is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed in the remaining days of the puppy's life is 185 x 2 cups = 370 cups.\n\nAdding the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days (180 cups) to the amount needed for the remaining days of the puppy's life (370 cups), we get a total of 550 cups of dog food needed for the first year.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number of bags of dog food required by dividing the total amount of dog food needed (550 cups) by the number of cups in one bag (110 cups): 550 / 110 = 5.

First, we need to calculate the amount of dog food needed during the first 180 days. This is equal to 1 cup per day multiplied by 180 days, which equals 180 cups. Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food needed after the first 180 days. This is equal to 2 cups per day multiplied by (365 - 180) days, which equals 720 cups. Finally, we need to determine the number of bags required for these amounts. One bag contains 110 cups, so 180/110 = 1.636 bags are needed for the first 180 days. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number, we get 2 bags. Therefore, the answer is 2 bags of dog food.
