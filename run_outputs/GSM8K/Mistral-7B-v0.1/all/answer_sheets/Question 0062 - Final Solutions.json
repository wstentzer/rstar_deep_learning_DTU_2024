At first, she receives a pension of 50000. After 20 years she gets an additional 5%. 50000 * (1+5/100) = 50000 * (1+5/200) = 50000 * (25/20) = 50000 * (5/4) = 62500.

Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years. So she was working for 30 years when she decided to leave. She receives a pension of $50,000 every year. After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of her pension each year. We don't know the details about what happens when you qualify for the pension increase after 20 years. But let's assume it goes like this: 5% of her previous year's pension for one year. 10% of her previous year's pension for the next year. 15% of her previous year's pension for the next year. And so on until it reaches 50%. This means that after 20 years, she received an additional 50% of her pension. That's 0.5 x $50,000 = $25,000. Marcy also received an additional 5% of her pension for three years after that. Let's call it x. We can figure out the value of x by solving this equation: 3x + 25,000 = 25,000. x = 0. So for those three years, she received no additional pension. After 30 years, Marcy had a total pension of $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.
