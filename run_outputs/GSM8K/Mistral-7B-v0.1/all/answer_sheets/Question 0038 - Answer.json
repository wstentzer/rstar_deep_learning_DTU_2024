{"id": 38, "problem": "John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.\nHe runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.\nSo for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nSo in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.\nSo he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
