We need to find out what Gerald's running time is. Let's call it \"G\". His initial running time was G seconds. Let's also say that Lee's running time was 38 - 2 = 36 seconds. Let's call it \"L\". We know that \"G\" is bigger than 38 because Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald.\n\nNow we need to figure out how much Gerald's running time decreased when he changed his diet. That is a 10% decrease. So Gerald's new running time (call this \"Gn\") will be 10% less than his original time. That is Gn = G * 0.9. And we can set that up as an equation:\n\nGn = G * 0.9\n\nThat means we can substitute in Gn instead of G in the previous equation we found about their relation. So G = L + 2, and Gn = L + 2 * 0.9. Now let's solve for L + 2.\n\nGn = L + 2 * 0.9\nL + 2 * 0.9 = L + 2\nsubtracting L from both sides\n0.9 = 2\ndividing both sides by 0.9\n1.0 = 2 / 0.9\nmultiplying both sides by 0.9\n0.9 * 1.0 = 2 / 0.9 * 0.9\nwhich is\n0.9 = 2\n\nAnd we know that G = L + 2, so we can put that back into our equation:\n\nGn = G * 0.9\nGn = (L + 2) * 0.9\nexpanding the brackets\nGn = L * 0.9 + 1.8\nsimplifying\nGn = 0.9L + 1.8\nsubtracting 1.8 from both sides\nGn - 1.8 = 0.9L\ndividing both sides by 0.9\n(Gn - 1.8) / 0.9 = L\nwe are given that Gn = 38\nso (Gn - 1.8) / 0.9 = L = 38 - 1.8 = 36.2\n\nSo Gerald's new running time is approximately 36 seconds.
