We know the top level has square footage of 16. Let's find out the square footage of the next level down. It has half the square footage as the top level, so 16/2 = 8. The next level down will also have half the square footage as the previous level. This means its square footage is 8/2 = 4. The fourth level down is 4/2 = 2.

We know that each layer decreases in size by half. This means that the next lower layer is 1/2 the size of the previous one. That would make the next lower layer a square footage of 8 (since 16 is 2 times larger than 8). We can also see this because the next lower layer's side length will be 4 since we said it's half the size of the previous layer's side length which was 8. But remember each layer has a square footage of 16 (since it's a square) so that means each side length has to be 4. If each side length is 4, then the area of this level is 4 x 4 = 16 (because it's a square). The answer is 16.\n\nHint 3: What is the bottom layer's square footage?
