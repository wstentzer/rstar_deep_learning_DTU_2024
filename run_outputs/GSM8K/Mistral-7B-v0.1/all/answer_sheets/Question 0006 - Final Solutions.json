First we need to determine the number of sheep in Toulouse and Seattle. Charleston is not needed yet. From condition 1, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Seattle has 20 sheep, as mentioned in condition 3. We don't need Charleston yet since it doesn't matter. So Toulouse has 160 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
