Condition 1 states that John runs 60 miles per week. This means that he must run approximately 20 miles per session, since he runs three times a week. As mentioned in the hint, this can be determined by dividing the 60 miles per week by three. Condition 2 indicates that he runs three times per week, so we know he runs three separate sessions. Condition 3 states that the first running session lasts for three hours, while the subsequent sessions are half that time. We can calculate the speed of each session by dividing the total distance (20 miles) by the duration of the session. Therefore, the speed of the first session would be 20 miles divided by three hours, which equals six miles per hour.
