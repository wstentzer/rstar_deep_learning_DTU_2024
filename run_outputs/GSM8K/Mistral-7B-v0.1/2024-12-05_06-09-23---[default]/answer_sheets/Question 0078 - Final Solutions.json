We want to know how much money he saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price. We need to work backwards to find out the difference. How much would you pay if you bought packages of 3 for 2.50? 18 times 0.83 is 14.94. That's how much he pays at the first price. At the second price, it would be 18 times 0.50, which is 9.
