Secondly, 2/3 of the girls are part of the Girl Scouts. Therefore, there are 2/3 of the girls who are part of the Girl Scouts. But we don't know exactly how many girls are part of the Girl Scouts yet. Let's assume it is x. We can write an equation for this: (x / 3) + 80 = 200. Solving this equation, we get x = 160. Thus, there are 160 girls who are part of the Girl Scouts. And there are 200 - 160 = 40 girls who are not part of the Girl Scouts. The answer is: 40.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 12}]
