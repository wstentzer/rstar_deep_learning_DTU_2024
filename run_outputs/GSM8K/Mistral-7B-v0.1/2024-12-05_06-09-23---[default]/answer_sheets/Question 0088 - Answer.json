{"id": 88, "problem": "Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000\nCombining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000\nDividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000\n#### 8000", "gold_answer": "8000"}
