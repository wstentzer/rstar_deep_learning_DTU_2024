A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Let's start with the blue fiber first. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber per robe, we can say that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber for every robe. This means that 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed for 1 robe. For the white fiber, it takes half of what is needed for blue fiber. So, half of 2 is 1. We can also write this as 1/2 or 0.5. This means that 1/2 bolt of white fiber is needed for every robe. To figure out how many bolts of white fiber are needed in total, we need to multiply the number of bolts of blue fiber by the number of bolts of white fiber. For example, if there are 3 robes, then we would need 3 bolts of blue fiber and 3/2 bolts of white fiber. We can write this as 3 bolts of blue fiber and 3/2 bolts of white fiber. Now that we know how many bolts of fiber are needed for each robe, we can find out how many bolts are needed in total. We know that 1 bolt of blue fiber is needed for 1 robe and 1/2 bolt of white fiber is needed for 1 robe. So, for 3 robes, we need 3 bolts of blue fiber and 3/2 bolts of white fiber. Multiplying these values gives us 3 x 3 = 9 bolts of blue fiber and 3/2 x 3 = 9/2 bolts of white fiber. Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for 3 robes is 9 bolts of blue fiber and 9/2 bolts of white fiber.
