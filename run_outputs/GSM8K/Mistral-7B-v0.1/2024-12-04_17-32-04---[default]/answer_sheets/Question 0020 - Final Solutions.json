I have 10 liters of orange drink that is two thirds water. 2/3 * 10 = 6.666. So the orange drink has 6.666 liters of water. I also have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three fifths water. We can find the amount of water in this by doing 3/5 * 15 which is 9 liters of water. Then I poured them together and spilled 1 liter. So my current mixture has 6.666 + 9 - 1 = 14.666 liters of water. However, we only want 24 liters of pineapple drink in total, so we need to remove 10.334 liters of water. To do that, let's first find the amount of liquid in 24 liters of pineapple drink. It will be 3/5 * 24 = 16 liters of liquid. Since the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.666 liters and the amount of liquid in the whole mixture is 14.666 liters, we can divide 6.666 by 14.666 to find out what proportion of the liquid in the whole mixture came from the orange drink. That means 6.666 / 14.666 is equal to the amount of orange drink in the whole mixture. So 14.666 * 6.666 / 14.666 is 10.334 liters of water in the whole mixture that needs to be removed.
