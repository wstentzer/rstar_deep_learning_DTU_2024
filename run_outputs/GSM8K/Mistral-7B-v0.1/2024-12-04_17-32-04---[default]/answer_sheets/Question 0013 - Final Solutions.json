The problem states that Melanie started with vacuum cleaners. This means we need to find the value for VC. Next, find the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house and the red house. The problem states that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, and 2 more to the red house. Let's call this X. We can rewrite this as:\n\nVC = (VC / 3) + 2\n\nSolving this equation for VC, we get:\n\nVC = 3X + 6\n\nNow let's calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house. The problem states that half of what was left were sold at the orange house. Let's call this Y. We can rewrite this as:\n\nY = (VC - X)/2\n\nSubstituting in for VC above, we get:\n\nY = ((3X + 6) - X)/2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nY = (2X + 6)/2\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nY = X + 3\n\nFinally, we add all the numbers together to get the final result:\n\nVC + X + Y = VC + X + (X + 3)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nVC + 2X + 3 = VC + X + 3\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nVC - X = 3\n\nSolving this equation for VC, we get:\n\nVC = 3 + X\n\nThis means that VC is equal to 3 + X. Substituting in our expression for X, we get:\n\nVC = 3 + ((VC / 3) + 2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(3VC + 9) / 3 = (VC / 3) + 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n3VC + 9 = VC + 6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2VC - VC = 3\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nVC = 3\n\nThis means that VC is equal to 3.

Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners. We don't know what that number is yet. However, we can calculate it using other information. At the green house, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners. A third of something means one third of every vacuum cleaner she started with. To figure out exactly what that amount is, we need to multiply the number of vacuum cleaners she started with by 1/3. 1/3 of 1 is 1/3, so if we had 1 vacuum cleaner, we would have 1/3. 1/3 of 2 is 2/3, so if we had 2 vacuum cleaners, we would have 2/3. 1/3 of 3 is 1, so if we had 3 vacuum cleaners, we would have 1. 1/3 of 4 is 4/3, so if we had 4 vacuum cleaners, we would have 4/3. It looks like every time we have 3 more, we get one less. We need to find out how many vacuum cleaners we had when we had 5/3 vacuum cleaners. That means we have to subtract 3 three times from 5/3. 5/3 - 3 = 2/3, 2/3 - 3 = -1/3, and -1/3 - 3 = -4/3. That means if we started with 5/3 vacuum cleaners, we ended up with -4/3 vacuum cleaners. That means we started with 5/3 vacuum cleaners minus 3 vacuum cleaners. 5/3 - 3 is 2/3. 2/3 is 1.666... We rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. So that means if she had 2 vacuum cleaners to start, she only has 5/3 vacuum cleaners. And 2/3 of 5 is 5/3. Therefore, we started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

First, condition 1 tells us that Melanie started with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners. Second, condition 2 tells us that she sells a third of the vacuum cleaners to the green house, 2 more to the red house, and then half of what's left to the orange house. Finally, condition 3 tells us that at the end of her sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. To solve this problem, we need to use logic and reasoning. According to the second condition, Melanie sells a third of the vacuum cleaners to the green house, 2 more to the red house, and then half of what's left to the orange house. Let's suppose that Melanie started with n vacuum cleaners. This means that initially, she has n vacuum cleaners. Based on the second condition, she sells 1/3 of those vacuum cleaners to the green house, which is equivalent to selling (n/3) vacuum cleaners. Additionally, she sells 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, bringing the total number of vacuum cleaners sold to (n/3) + 2. Based on the same condition, she then sells half of what's left to the orange house, leaving her with (n/3) + 2 - (n/3) = 2/3 of the original number of vacuum cleaners. This leaves her with 2/3 of the original number of vacuum cleaners. According to the third condition, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means that she started with 5/(2/3) = 15/2 = 7.5 vacuum cleaners. However, since the starting number cannot be a fraction, we can safely say that she started with 7 vacuum cleaners.
