Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, which is 4 miles/hour. She also walked the next two miles in 1 hour, which is 2 miles/hour. Since the total distance was 12 miles, we want to calculate the time needed for her to walk the remaining distance. We know that her average speed is 4 miles/hour, so we can use this information to solve for the unknown time.\n\nWe can start by calculating the total time spent walking thus far. Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so that's 1 hour. She also walked the next 2 miles in 1 hour, so that's 1 more hour. That's a total of 2 hours spent walking the first 6 miles.\n\nTo find out how long it would take to walk the remaining 6 miles, we can set up a ratio equation using the known speed of 4 miles/hour and the unknown time. The ratio of speed to time is equal to the constant 4, which means that the time it takes to walk 1 mile is equal to 4 divided by 4, or 1. Thus, the time it takes to walk the remaining 6 miles is 6 times 1, or 6 hours.\n\nIn summary, Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, the next 2 miles in 1 hour, and the last 6 miles in 6 hours.

We know she travelled 4 mph for 1 hour, so that is 4 miles. Therefore, she must have traveled 6 - 4 = 2 miles at an adjusted speed. This is because we need to maintain an average speed of 4 mph.
