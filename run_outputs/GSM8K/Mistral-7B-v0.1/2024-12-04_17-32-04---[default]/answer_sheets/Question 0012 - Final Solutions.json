First, we need to find out how long it takes until the money earned from selling the lemons exceeds the cost of watering and feeding the tree. To calculate this, we must first determine the annual profit (the amount of money earned) and subtract the cost of watering and feeding. Let's assume Carlos plants the lemon tree and begins to earn money from selling lemons. After one year, he will have sold 7 lemons (at $1.5 per lemon), resulting in a total of $10.50. However, he must also pay for the cost of watering and feeding the tree, which is $3. This means that after one year, he will have made a net profit of $10.50 - $3, or $7.50. The next year, assuming he still has a healthy lemon tree, he will again have sold 7 lemons (at $1.5 per lemon), resulting in a total of $10.50. But again, he must also pay for the cost of watering and feeding the tree, which is $3. This means that after two years, he will have made a net profit of $10.50 - $3, or $7.50. We can continue this pattern, and it turns out that after n years, he will have sold 7n lemons (at $1.5 per lemon), resulting in a total of 10.5n. But he must also pay for the cost of watering and feeding the tree n times, which is 3n. Thus, after n years, he will have made a net profit of 10.5n - 3n, or 7.5n. We want to find the value of n when this becomes positive, i.e., when the net profit becomes greater than zero. In other words, we want to know when 7.5n > 0, or equivalently, when n > 0. This tells us that as soon as the lemon tree is planted, Carlos will begin making money from selling its lemons, and it only takes him one year to reach a net profit.
