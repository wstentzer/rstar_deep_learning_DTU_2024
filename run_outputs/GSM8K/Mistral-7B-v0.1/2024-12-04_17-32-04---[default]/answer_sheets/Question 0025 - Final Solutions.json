Five packs of milk each cost $3. Four apples each cost $1.50. So the total cost of everything besides the pizza is $12 + 5 x 3 + 4 x 1.5. That is $12 + 15 + 6. That is 33.

So 50 must equal 33 + 2 x 8.5. We can solve for 2x. 50 = 33 + 2 x 8.5. Subtract 33 from both sides. 50 - 33 = 2 x 8.5. 17 = 2 x 8.5.
